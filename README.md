# map-standup

To break the monotony of the usual standup, (e.g. looking at the kanban sprint board, each person takes turn to talk in an expected order)
A fun twist is to go geographically, especially for a distributed team. 
If multiple team members are in the same state, can mouseover per county

To introduce some randomness of the order:  
- Go east to west, north to south
- Start with the state with the most electoral votes
